1.Your company delivers fruit and vegetables to local grocery stores, 
and you need to track the mileage driven by each driver each day to a tenth of a mile. 
Assuming no driver would ever travel more than 999 miles in a day,
what would be an appropriate data type for the mileage column in your table? 
Why?
2.In the table listing each driver in your company, 
what are appropriate data types for the driversâ€™ first and last names? 
Why is it a good idea to separate first and last names into two columns rather than having one larger name column?
